# CESAM: Code d'Evolution Stellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire

**CESAM** is a code aimed at simulating stellar evolution and internal structure, this is a 1D
model mainly written by Pierre Morel, see [Morel P. (1997)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997A%26AS..124..597M%2F/abstract) 
and [Morel & Lebreton (2008)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008Ap%26SS.316...61M/abstract). The code made available
in the current repository corresponds to the **CESAM version 3.2** with some adaptations and development made by
D. Cordier during his PhD thesis.
