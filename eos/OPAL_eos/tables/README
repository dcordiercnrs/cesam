	This directory contains equation of state(EOS) data files and 
corresponding interpolation codes.  The equation of state tables are an 
extension and update of the EOS and EOSplus tables.  The temperature-density 
range of the EOS and EOSplus tables accommodates temperature-density values 
characteristic of stars having masses greater than about 0.8 solar.  The 
EOS_2001 tables cover temperature_density values encountered in stars having 
masses greater than about 0.1 solar. A number of changes have been made to 
the OPAL EOS code since the 1996 tables were calculated; primarily electrons 
are now treated relativistically and the activity expansion method has been 
improved for repulsive interactions. In addition to H2 and  H2_plus molecules, 
and the H_, negative ion, He2+, HeH+ are now also included.

        NOTE: Updates to the fortran codes: IEOSxtrin.f and IEOSxtrin_H_He.f
were made on 6 Mar 2002. These updates include bug fixes. If you use these
codes, please download the latest versions.

	The format of the tables is different than that used in the opacity 
directory.  For the EOS, data is tabulated at constant T6 and density(rho), 
rather than constant T6 and R (T6=temperature in units of 10**6 K, R=rho/T6**3), 
rho is density in g/cc).  Herein, X is the hydogen mass  fraction, and Z is the 
mass fraction of all elements heavier than helium.  The helium mass fraction,Y,
is thus, Y=1-X-Z.

	The EOS data is tabulated at Z=0.0,0.02,and 0.04; X=0.0,0.2,0.4,0.6 and 0.8.  
A pure hydrogen table (X=1, Z=0) is also available. The number of Z and X 
values is less than for the opacity tables, due to that fact that the EOS 
does not vary as greatly with changes in these variables. The temperature is
tabulated in the range 0.002  to 100.0 and the density in the range
10**(-14) to 10**7 grams/cc.  (Note: much of the region around rho=10**(-14) 
is radiation dominated and is included mainly for convenience of tabulation.)  
The lower temperature limit of the tables gradually increases for densities 
 > 0.00237 gm/cc.

	The IEOS*z%x.gz files are the EOS data in compressed format for Z=* and 
X=%;i.e., IEOS02z4x.gz corresponds to Z=0.02 and X=0.4.

	The Z_interp_IEOS.f code interpolates the IEOS*z%x files for a
fixed value of Z, creating a file 'EOSdata.gz'. The EOSdata.gz file is used
by IEOS_xtrin.f to interpolate in X, T6, and rho at the fixed value of Z
used to construct the EOSdata.gz file.  The accuracy of the
interpolation has been checked by comparison with a large sample of
test calculations.  Better than four place accuracy is generally achieved
with both first and second order properties.  At very low density 
(rho < 1.e-8), in regions of rapid change, the first order properties are 
occasionally off by as much as  a few % and the second order properties 
can be off by 10 percent.  Direct differentiation of the interpolated
first order properties is most likely less accurate and is not recommended.
[[
	Since the Z dependent effects are quite modest for population I & II 
mixtures, the Z=0 EOS is adequate for many purposes.  In this case the Z_interp_IEOS.f
is not required to create the EOSdata.gz file. Instead the EOSdata_H-He.gz file
can be used in conjunction with the Z_interp_IEOS_H-He.f interpolation code.  
The EOS-data_H-He file covers the full range of X and Y;i.e., the 5 IEOS0z%x 
files plus the IEOS0zxx file (for pure H).  

	In order to calculate derivatives of the EOS, a very fine 
temperature-density grid was used.  The tabulated data is a condensation 
of this information.  The computer time required to calculate for the actual stellar 
mixture would be substantial, so a truncated mixture was used.  In the 
truncated mixture the mass contribution of all elements above neon where 
added in with the neon.  Contrary to the situation with opacity, these 
high Z elements never contribute substantially

	The fractional elemental number components of Z for the reduced mixture are
(Grevesse, N. 1991, A&A 242,488):

		XC= 0.2471362
		XN= 0.0620778
 		XO= 0.528368 
		XNe=0.1624178

The corresponding number fractions, including hrdrogen and heliun, are listed at the 
front of each of the IEOS*z%x files.  More recent estimates of  steller element 
abundances change these values slightly, but have very small affect on the EOS.
